# YOLOv5-potholes-detection
Annotated images were used for model training with the help of RoboFlow. we can certainly improve the efficiency a lot by improving the amount of data that we have. 

The labelling of images with the target area for model training is tiresome in object detection techniques. so, i have used very little amount of data for just demonstration
purpsoe.

we can tweak with the hyper-parameters as well for increase in the accuracy.
